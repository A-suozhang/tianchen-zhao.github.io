> 🎁 Congratulations! You've discovered a hidden easter egg page. Here, I'll share a glimpse into my life beyond academia. You got to see these stuff cause I'm a huge information hoarder. 

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 48px; margin-bottom: 40px;">
  <img src="/media/icon.png" alt="A-suozhang" style="width: 180px; height: 180px; border-radius: 50%; display: block; margin: 0 auto 32px auto;" />
  <div style="font-size: 2.6em; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 2px;">A-suozhang</div>
  <div style="font-size: 1.1em; color: #888; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: 0.5px; margin-top: 0;">(Me outside of academia)</div>
</div>

I use the same ID (SuoZhang) for all social media, kinda like a "Alter-Ego" for me (with the figure in the picture above). I have an old blog at [https://a-suozhang.xyz/](https://a-suozhang.xyz/) since my undergrad years, it's immature and dummy but I am not ashamed of it, okay, maybe a little. 


## 🤓 Nerdy Stuff

I'm an authentic nerd from my teenage years. I'm a huge fan of TRPG (Table-top Role Playing Games), such as [DND](https://www.dndbeyond.com/) (Dungeons and Dragons), and had joined and hosted several campaigns (not so frequent recently). I also play [MTG](https://magic.wizards.com/en) (magic the gathering) card game (also not so frequent recently).  


## 📝 Content Creation

#### 📸 Photography

I like pressing some shutters on trips, and sometimes random walks in the city. Sometimes I share them in platforms like [Twitter](https://x.com/A_Suozhang98), [Red Book](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/user/profile/5ef54e050000000001002087), or [G-core](https://www.gcores.com/articles/146575).


#### 🎧 Music

I enjoyed music from multiple genres, and learning guitar and keyboard now. Hopefully I could be a rookie bedroom musician in a year or so with my MiniLab 3. 


#### 🖥️ AI Content Generation

I've been conducting research about visual generative models since 2023. Therefore, I also played with diffusion models for a bit of my own entertainment.

- I've created a series of emoji packs based on my virtual persona (you could find it on wechat searching "suozhang" in emojis). They achieves nearly 10,000 downloads each, significantly surpassing my open-source code.

- I also create my custom MTG cards with diffusion models based on the character and story in my DND campaign (yeah, that nerdy), see further in [this G-Core Post](https://www.gcores.com/talks/631809).

## 💡 Undergrad Startup Project

In my undergrads years, I wasted my time on a startup project with a bunch of my fellas (tech lead [Song Tiancheng](https://github.com/rotom407?tab=followers), and art director [Liu Yuxin](https://github.com/Ryushane)) called **Marvis** (Jarvis + Muscle), a interactive assistant for electromyogram (EMG, electrical signal when muscle moves). I summarize it into [this post](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Bqr8Ioa_wCNGJYN-u1t8GQ) when I was seeking grad student positions. 

We build the software and hardware system that acquire **muscle electrical signal** from multiple parts of the body (attached on a shirt), and design algorithm for action recognition for **human-computer iteration**. You could *literally* control electrical devices with your "bare hands" like Iron man.

We designed the circuit and printed the PCB. The 'core' is housed inside a 3D-printed casing positioned at the center of the chest, with breathing light, basically a shameless tribute to Tony Stark, lol.

It won some awards for student startup competitions, and got reported by Beijing-TV.

We also have a cool demo video here, If you are interested:
